Requirments: 
requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml


*Heads Up* :AssemblyAI now requires billing information to view the transcription queue dashboard(to get the transcript id), it's still free but one extra step

Uploaded a Juypter Notebook, will also upload a Python script with a cleaned up version. 

Some images are attached showing some ouptut when I put in the keyword "kanye" under Lex Fridmans podcast.
