# Podcast-Scraper-w-AI-Transcription
Python program that downloads and transcribes podcasts based on keywords you like

You can enter any amount of keywords and tailor it to whatever niche you prefer

AI Transcription done with AssemblyAI (https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/guides/transcribing-an-audio-file)
but you can use AWS or a bunch of other API's out there.


Requirments: 
requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml


*Heads Up* :AssemblyAI now requires billing information to view the transcription queue dashboard(to get the transcript id), it's still free but one extra step

Uploaded a Juypter Notebook, will also upload a Python script with a cleaned up version. 

Some images are attached showing some ouptut when I put in the keyword "kanye" under Lex Fridmans podcast.
